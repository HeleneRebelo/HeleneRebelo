### About me ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

I worked on projects that aimed to enhance economic growth, digital markets, corporate governance, innovation strategies, strategic business analysis, and environmental economics, using quantitative, qualitative, and econometric methods. Motivated by a desire to expand my skill set, I decided to broaden my horizons by developing other skills that transformed me into a data scientist.

Throughout this journey, I have refined my abilities in programming, data engineering, generative AI, recommendation systems, data analysis, and visualization using Python and SQL. However, what truly captivates me is the holistic Machine Learning solution lifecycle, enabling me to devise efficient strategies for complex business problems and articulate them clearly and concisely with actionable recommendations. My GitHub repositories showcase my ability to employ computational techniques to analyze business datasets with creativity and precision.
