### About me ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

I worked on projects that boosted economic growth, digital markets, corporate governance, innovation strategies, strategic business analysis, and environmental economics, using quantitative, qualitative, and econometric methods. 
I leveraged my background and knowledge, I decided to broaden my horizon by developing other skills that are transforming me into a data scientist.

I am currently advancing my skills at WBS Coding School, where I have refining my skills in programming, data engineering, data visualization, and WebDeV (Frontend), however, I am fascinated by Python and Machine Learning, as well as the entire process of cleaning, exploring, visualizing data, implementing analysis, and providing actionable recommendations. These repositories showcased on my GitHub illustrate my adeptness in applying computational techniques to analyze business datasets with creativity and accuracy.
